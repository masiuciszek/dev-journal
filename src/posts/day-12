## Friday lats day of the week

The whole week has gone so fast I learned a lot , specially feeling more and more comfatble with the whole work concept here at the company as well.
There is nothing new too say that I really enyoj to be here , I always learn new things and everyone i super friendly. 
I don't say it's easy for me but I don't want to be like that either. I think you need to struggle and to spot on some harder to task to really become better, but that's with eveything in life.

I been able to make 2 pull request this week and merged both of them to the master. It is always a happy feeling when you code passses all the unit tests, e2e test and also all the reviews from the developers.
A really good feeling. 

Like I said I am happy and already look forward to the next week!
