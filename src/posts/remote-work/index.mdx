# Road trip , working remotely for 5 days.

From Wends day 26 until Saturday 29 I will work remotely. I am on my way to Poland to celebrate my cousinâ€™s wedding.
I still have my computer with me and trying to work as much as I can and still join my daily meetings, (remotely).
I see this as well as an opportunity to learn how to work with a big team remotely, to celebrate and to have a good connection with your team.
This is a very important skill to have as a developer, to be able to calibrate with your team even if you are not at the office.
With tools like _Slack_ and _Google meet_ it becomes much easier to be productive and active when working remotely.
I am writing this post right after my fight home from Poland and just summarize the last 4 days.
It almost feels like I have been away for weeks, Just because so much happened through the last 4 days.
We (me and my father) had a car accident, and almost didn't make it to come to the wedding, but we made it.
A crazy 2-day Polish wedding, trust me I never seen such a crazy wedding.
On top of that I really felt productive and actually worked on what I planned. I joined all the meetings and all the daily stand ups in our team.
I made a new _PR_ and merged it into production. I was actually surprised and had a real good feeling.
Maybe because I thought I will not be able to do anything, and I did. ðŸ¤“
This week will be a week I will never forget so much happened but that is not relative to this blog and perhaps will be written in another post.
