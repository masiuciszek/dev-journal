## Another merge day

A great day. Adter ower noramal stand up at 9 a clock. I had to my mmachine and started to fix my PR. II got some comments and opinions from different people that I wanted to fix.
I actullu llearend something very cool today. I am a big fan of functional programiing and really want to go into that dirrection of mmy progromin carrieer.
I will not go into deeep on this topic because
I feel I could write a really long blog post about this if I wanted.
But a team memeber that also is a fan of FP showed me how I can actully take advantage of curring in React, specially in on of the situatuion that I spot on , on the code I jjust wrote and made a PR on.

My job was to define a function outside the componenent that then was seended as a prop to another component. The trick was that it was usinig a custom hook property that only could be defined inside the component itself.
By passing a extra argument would just make it harder. I would have to go into the other componenent and change a lot of logic. A lot of overhead right ?

So what was the solution ??.... CURRYING !!! λ🥳⚛️😍

```jsx
const foo = val => anotherVal => {
  fn(val, anotherVal);
};
```

**Component**

```jsx
const Component = props => {
  const { val } = someHoook();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{props.title}</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
```
