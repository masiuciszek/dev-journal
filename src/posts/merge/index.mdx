## Another merge day

A great day. After ower normal stands up at 9 a clock. I had to my machine and started to fix my PR. II got some comments and opinions from different people that I wanted to fix.
I actually learned something very cool today. I am a big fan of functional programming and really want to go into that direction of my program in a carrier.
I will not go into deep on this topic because
I feel I could write a really long blog post about this if I wanted.
But a team member that also is a fan of FP showed me how I can actually take advantage of curring in React, especially in on of the situation that I spot on, on the code I just wrote and made a PR on.

My job was to define a function outside the component that then was seeded as a prop to another component. The trick was that it was using a custom hook property that only could be defined inside the component itself.
Bypassing an extra argument would just make it harder. I would have to go into the other component and change a lot of logic. A lot of overhead rights?

So what was the solution ??.... CURRYING !!! Œªü•≥‚öõÔ∏èüòç

**function outside the component**

```jsx
const foo = val => anotherVal => {
  fn(val, anotherVal);
};
```

**Component**

```jsx
const Component = props => {
  const { val } = someHoook();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{props.title}</h1>
      <AnotherComponent onFoo={foo(val)} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

I didn't know that you can pass down the first value by calling the function while you sending it as a prop. In this way, the _AnotherComponent_ will have access
to it without passing down any extra arguments. This all thanks to the curried function!
A really cool way of doing things, and a functional way of writing your code. If you are interested I definitely recommend reading _Kyle Simpsons book_ [Function light](https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS).

## Tips for today

- If you are stuck, ask for help, you will just learn!. üòä
- Learn FP it is a really powerful tool, at least the basics! Œªüêô
