# day five ⚛️😎

Day five and I starting to get into a god work flow with the team. I coming in to the office in the morning after my morning run , grabbing a sandwich and a coffee and starting up my machine.
Our _DS_(**Daily stand up**) is starting in 10 min, where we always talk about what we working on right now and how it goes ore if we need any help by our colleagues.
I starting a new task today wich I laready planed from yesterday. Writing more tests but also rewriting some old React class components into React hooks.
I really looking forward for every task I get , I feel that I learning a lot and also getting all the help I needed.

We also have every friday a small party around 3 a clock, where the team from Athens also joins through the web cam. We getting new inforamtion and plans about what the Co has come with, having a quiz about the week and company.
