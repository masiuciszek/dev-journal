# day five ⚛️😎

Day five and I starting to get into a good workflow with the team. I coming into the office in the morning after my morning run, grabbing a sandwich and a coffee and starting up my machine.
Our _DS_(**Daily stand up**) is starting in 10 min, where we always talk about what we working on right now and how it goes ore if we need any help from our colleagues.
I start a new task today which I already planed from yesterday. Writing more tests but also rewriting some old React class components into React hooks.
I really looking forward to every task I get, I feel that I learning a lot and also getting all the help I needed.

We also have every Friday a small party around 3 a clock, where the team from Athens also joins through the webcam. We getting new information and plans about what the Co has come with, having a quiz about the week and company.
Of course some snacks🍿 on that 👍🏻.

- Think in a better way of how to write the tests.

## Tips
