## Monday, love Mondays!!

A normal Monday today I guess, nothing special to say then it is cool to be here. O really love the place and the people here.
Been working on mostly with React today and fixing a third-party, widget from Bookin.coim on our site.
Nice to create things that really go into production. Even if you working on smaller things, it really matters a lot.
After I finished working on my component I wrote some tests for it to have good test coverage. There was some extra logic in the component that I had to fix,
for example, what would happen if there were only a single trip. Then I had to fix that as well.
The dates get auto-filled depending on when you arrive and when you are going home.

## What I learned today

- be a better developer
- debugging and thinking about case scenarios.
