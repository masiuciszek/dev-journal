## Another Friday, what happened during the week

Another week has been passed and it feels sad that all this great stuff will come to an end soon. I will be back in school in the first week of October.
I almost feel depressed when I thinking about it. I really found my routines and have a really good time here, feel like I could be here forever and that I have been here for a much longer time then my whole intern period.
I hope I could really come back for my second intern period in January, it would really be fantastic.

But After a meeting today I got some really good news. I Will have my second internship here at _Etravli_ and also I will come and work here 3 days a week (when I am not in school)
the period, before my second intern. I am really happy and thankful for this situation. A great day today.
