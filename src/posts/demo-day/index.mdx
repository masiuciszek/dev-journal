## Today is Demo day

Today is Demo day, demo day is a meeting we have for all the front end teams every third-week. If some developer has worked on something big,
we show it for the team on how it looks and works right now and what is left. Great opportunity to see what everyone working on but also for the project leader to see that
we have _work in progress_.
Coool to see what awesome developers we have here at Etravli. This was my second Demo day since I came here.

Today I also did another PR, some _Tech impovemnts_ I the code base, I think it is really good to go back to old code and refactor them, especially if it has been written a few years ago.
This could be, for example, rewrite class components into functional components, removing unused code blocks, write new unit tests for just that component.

## tips for today (some repeated tips, but hey...!)

- Read others code
- Strive for improvement
- Rewrite old code to a newer version (if you can).
