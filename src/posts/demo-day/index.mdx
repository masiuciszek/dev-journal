## Today is Demo day

Today is Demo day , demo day is a meeting we have for all the front end teams every third-week. If some devloper has working on something big,
we show it for the team on how it look and works right now and what is left. Great oppertinuty to see what everyone working on but also for the project leader to see that
we have _work in progress_.
Coool to see what awsome devlopers we have here at Etravli. This was my second Demo day since I camed here.
