# Set up the machine!

It was a big day for me today, my first day of my intersnship at _[EtraveliGroup](https://www.etraveligroup.com/)_.
I was really nervous already 1 week before, just thinking on what could go possibly wrong but I guess that is just hom I am.
Everything was just the oppocite what I expected. They where super nice and already after the first day they I felt that I was a part of the family.

I knew that this would be my chance to prove them that this is what I really want and that one day be part of the front-end React team at _[EtraveliGroup](https://www.etraveligroup.com/)_.

## What was my tasks on 2020-08-17 ?

When I camed to the desk in the morning I got a brand new
mac book prop 16inch and with 32 gb ram of memory. I coulden't belive it, it waz really amazing, oh I forgot that I got a brand new screen and my task and all the tools I needed with jeyboard and etc.

I had a lot to to tady , configure my computer , set up all the SSH key I needed, set up my profile, set up worklflows like _Git_ and _Docker_, and a lot of other stuff. The day was really heavy but I really wanted to fix every thing today because I wanted to get into the code as soon as possible.
As a good news I manged to set up everything and I was actaully happy of what i acomplished today.

They told me that not everyone that are new manage to get everything to work the very first day.

## My tips

What I can give you as a tip when you have your first day at your work.
Read the manual slowly and pacient, take your time, there is no need for rush. It will just take more time then you think
. Have fun and try to bind contact to as much collegues as possible, then you will already make a big step at your new work.
