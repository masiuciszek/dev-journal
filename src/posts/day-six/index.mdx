# Felling more like home!

It really feels more like home and I started to feel comfortable at the office and always look forward to the next day. It is really a special feeling to belong to a team and know that you can deliver something.
I love it and to be a developer in my opinion is the best thing I could possibly imagine.

## What were my tasks today?

Maintaining some code, rewriting enzyme test into the React testing library, and having a lot of fun with my teammates.
Oh yes, I rewrote another class component into a functional component using React hooks.
My plans for tomorrow will be a surprise, I also started to plan for my remote work for 3 days. I leaving on Wednesday just for 3 days to be at my cousin's wedding.
I will work remotely as much as I can, and will be back in the office on Monday.

## My tips for today

- be patient
- have fun
- learn a new task for the day
- discipline
- aks for help when you are stuck!
