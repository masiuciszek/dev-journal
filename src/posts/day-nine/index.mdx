## Another great day üöÄ

Except for working on the project we had a nice dinner today with the front end team. We had a new team member that joined the team so we had a nice lunch together.
Everything goes well and I thank god for every day that I landed at this place. I learn new things every day and I also feel that I can apply those skills into my work.
Right now I working on some tech improvements on the project and getting deeper and deeper into the codebase.
refactor some components into hooks, testing some components with _Jest_ and _React testing library_.
Did another PR today so for tomorrow I will expect to get back some reviews that I will need to fix to be able to merge my PR into master.

## My tips for today

- Help others and be patient with your work.
- Take your time and make your code readable.
- Make your PR before you finish work, then you will have something to work on straight away when you come into the office in the morning.
- Read [Common mistake with React Testin Library by Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/common-mistakes-with-react-testing-library)
