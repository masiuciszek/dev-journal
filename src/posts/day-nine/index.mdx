## Another great day 🚀

Except from working on the project we had a nice dinner today with the front end team. We had a new team member that joined the team so we had a nice lunch together.
Everything goes well and I thank god for every day that I landed at this place. I learn new things for every day and I also feel taht I can apply those skills in to my work.
Right now I working on some tech improvments on the project and getting deeper and deepr into the codebase.
refactor some components into hooks , testing some components with _Jest_ and _React testing library_.

## My tips for today

- Help others and be pacient with your work.
- Take your time and make your code readable.
