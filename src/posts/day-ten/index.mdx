## Day Ten

Important day today. We had an important Dev meeting from the whole front end team where we were supposed to collect as many issues that we want to discuss and to be able perhaps to find any solution.
There always one member from each team the will represent your team, Me and my friend Oskar were the chosen ones. We discussed a lot of good things, I will not take up these subjects here, because there is no basic purpose for that. What I can take from this meeting is that I learned a lot about how important it is to work in an Agile way, how all devs listen to each other and help each other. This is a sign of how a successful team works and always strive for progress.

## What I did today.
