## Java ... ? Me ? Really

I would never think I personally would write some java code. I actually have nothing against it, I am a developer and I see that IO developer should try all different tools when she/he gets the opportunity.
Why I wrote some Java is because I took a story that included some backend work, I knew it and saw this as an opportunity to learn something new.
I would personally never thought me personally would write Java, but I did ðŸ˜‡.
Nothing special than a normal today other that I been working on some complex things which I think is really cool.

## Tips for today

- write your code first in the language you are comfortable with and then translate into some other language, for example in this case (Java).
- Be open to **ALWAYS** learn new things.
- OOP, FP ore any other coding paradigm is always good to learn.
