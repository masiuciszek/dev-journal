## Java ... ? Me ? Really

I would never thought the me personlly would write some java code. I actually have nothing aginst it ,I am a devloper and I see that IO devloper should try all different tools when she/he gets the oppertinuty.
Why I wrote some Java is because I took a story that included somke backend work, I knew it and saw this as a opertunity to learn something new.
I would personllay never thought the me personally would write Java, but I did ðŸ˜‡.
Nothing special then a normall today other that I been working on some complex things wich I think is realltyy cool.

## Tips for today

- write youur code first in the language you are comfable with annd then translate into some other language, for example in this case (Java).
- Be open to **ALWAYS** learn new things.
