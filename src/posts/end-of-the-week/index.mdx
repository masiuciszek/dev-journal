## Friday lats day of the week

The whole week has gone so fast I learned a lot, especially feeling more and more comfortable with the whole work concept here at the company as well.
There is nothing new to say that I really enjoy being here, I always learn new things, and everyone I super friendly.
I don't say it's easy for me but I don't want to be like that either. I think you need to struggle and to spot on some harder to the task to really become better, but that's with everything in life.

I been able to make 2 pull requests this week and merged both of them to the master. It is always a happy feeling when your code passes all the unit tests, e2e test, and also all the reviews from the developers.
A really good feeling.
