Retro

A Retro meeting is a meeting where your team gathers and talk about what happend from a given periods (last time the team had a Retro meeting) and to know, posetive thins, what could be better and if there is any questions for the whole workflow.
We have it here mostly every 5th week +- depending on the needs. It is a verry good oppetinuty to reflect on what we actaully accived and what we can take from this period and what we can improve.
It's simalar like a BIG spring if you are used tow work with Scrum. We work like Kanban/Scrum ish , nothing is written in stone but we follow both priceples. 
It was a verry good meeting with great inputs from every one. There is much we can do to strive for improvment and should always bee te goal , for every team. Specially if you ask me.
