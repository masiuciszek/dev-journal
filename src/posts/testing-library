## The value of writing good tests

I always felt that writing tests is not nesecery and is not what a devloper should write, but I had wrong , I had a BIG wrong stamp on this one. 
I really see the value in writing tests, as long you are testing the right parts and knowing what you need and should to test it's a verry useful tool.
Testing React apps I am a big fan of React-testing-library by Kent C Dodds. Lucky for me that is the tool we using here at the company. 

I have never beeen good at writing tests but since there is a ploicy here that for every component we write you as a developer should write unit test for that component. 
I think it's a verry good habit to write tests for the code you just wrote. What do you expect to happend, pretend that you are the user and want to interact with the component. 
Tests should be easy to understand and you should know what you really need to test. 

I higly recomend to read Kent C dodds blog about different useful topics that really helps on how you should think when testing your React components.
