## Retro

A Retro meeting is a meeting where your team gathers and talks about what happened from a given period (last time the team had a Retro meeting) and to know, positive thins, what could be better, and if there are any questions for the whole workflow.
We have it here mostly every 5th week +- depending on the needs. It is a very good opportunity to reflect on what we actually achieved and what we can take from this period and what we can improve.
It's similar to a BIG spring if you are used to working with Scrum. We work like Kanban/Scrum ish, nothing is written in stone but we follow both principles.
It was a very good meeting with great inputs from everyone. There is much we can do to strive for improvement and should always bee the goal, for every team. Especially if you ask me.
Everyone in the team was really happy yo have me in the team and took it up that in their speech. To feel appreciate it is a great feeling and would give you some boost to perform even more.
