# Second day

Today I started on my very first task and created the branch for the given task.
My task was to do our Privacy policy page, redesign the page with the given design and also add some functionality.
It's always different to jump into code that someone else has been written compare start something from scratch.
This is a really good practice, to just take a while and read the code on what's really going on.

After a while you start to understand how the code works and what you should change and what you should not, you don't want to break any tests, trust me!
So working on that, it took all day but I got really happy about how it went. My mentor looked at the code and the result of the application and was happy with what I produced. The next thing for me was to make my very first PR, pull request. I would get my very first code review from everyone in the front-end team. It was a really strange feeling but something I really looked forward to, to get criticized and to improve as a developer.

## What I learned

- Read and understand the code before getting started.
- What is really going on and plan on what could go wrong.
- Be comfortable to just jump into any codebase and start to work.
- Write a test , fix braking tests.

## Tips

Don't stress, don't be afraid to do anything wrong,
you will just improve as a developer because you will
have a code review where more experienced developers will go through
your code and tell you what was good and what you could improve.
This perhaps sounds scary but this way will just make to a much better developer.
