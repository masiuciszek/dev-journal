# Second day

Today I started on my very first task, and created the branch for the given task.
My task was to do our Privacy policy page , redisgn the page with the given design and also add some funktionality.
It's always different to jump into code that somone else have been written compare start something from scratch.
This is a really good practice , to just take a while and read the code on what's really going on .

After a while you start to understand how the code works and what you should change and what you should not, you don't want to brake any tests, trust me!
So working on that , it took all the day but I got really happy on how it went. My mentor looked at the code and the result of the application, and was happy on what I produced. Next thing for me was to make my very first PR, pull request. I would get my very first code review from everyone in the front-end team. I was a really strange feeling but something I really looked forward to, to get criticised and to improve as a developer.

## What I learend

Read and understand the code before getting started. What is really going on and plan on waht could go wrong. Be comftable to just jump into any codebase and start to work.

## Tips

Don't stress, dont be afraid to do anything wrong, you will just improve as a developer becasue you will have a code review where more experince developers will go through your code and tell you waht was good and what was wrong.
