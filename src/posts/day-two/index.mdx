# Second day

Today I started on my very first task, and created the branch for the given task.
My task was to do our Privacy policy page , redisgn the page with the given design and also add some funktionality.
It's always different to jump into code that somone else have been written compare start something from scratch.
This is a really good practice , to just take a while and read the code on what's really going on .

After a while you understand how the code works and what you should change and what you should not, you don't want to brake any tests!
