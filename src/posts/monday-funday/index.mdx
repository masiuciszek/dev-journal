## The value of writing good tests

I always felt that writing tests is not necessary and is not what a developer should write, but I had wrong, I had a BIG wrong stamp on this one.
I really see the value in writing tests, as long you are testing the right parts and knowing what you need and should to test it's a very useful tool.
Testing React apps I am a big fan of React-testing-library by Kent C Dodds. Lucky for me that is the tool we use here at the company.

I have never been good at writing tests but since there is a policy here that for every component we write you as a developer should write a unit test for that component.
I think it's a very good habit to write tests for the code you just wrote. What do you expect to happen, pretend that you are the user and want to interact with the component?
Tests should be easy to understand and you should know what you really need to test.

I highly recommend reading [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/) blog about different useful topics that really help on how you should think when testing your React components.
With writing tests, you will have a much better perspective on the whole application. You will be more comfortable that things work as you expected.

With that, I really enjoy writing tests now and see the whole value in that as well. I am a much better developer thanks to writing tests and I really recommend you to do so as well.
