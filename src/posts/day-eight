## Another day

Except from working on the project we had a nicer dinner today with the front end team. We had a new team member that joined the team so we had a nice lunch together.
Everything goes well and I thank god for every day that I landed at this place. I learn new things for every day and I also feel taht I can apply those skills in to my work.
Right now I working on some tech improvments on the project and getting deeper and deepr into the codebase.
