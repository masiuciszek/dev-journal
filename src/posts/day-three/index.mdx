# Third day ⚛️

My PR, pull had to be declined for a moment because I spot a bug that the code I wrote affected 2 other routes as well, which I don't want to do.
I fixed this with scoping the code to just the component that I wanted affect, both CSS code and some JS logic.
I made this with the help of some closures and with emotion helpers CSS function.
After I fixed the issue I opened my PR again and, I got approved to buy the team that I was ready for my first merge.

The feeling was really amazing, even if the code was nothing special, just to have that feeling that you know that your code will go into production and be used by a lot of people.
Pretty cool in my opinion.

## What I learned

- Read and understand the code before getting started.
- What is really going on and plan on what could go wrong.
- Be comfortable to just jump into any codebase and start to work.
- Write a test , fix braking tests.

## Tips

Don't stress, don't be afraid to do anything wrong,
you will just improve as a developer because you will
have a code review where more experienced developers will go through
your code and tell you what was good and what you could improve.
This perhaps sounds scary but this way will just make to a much better developer.
