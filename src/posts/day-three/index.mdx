# Third day ⚛️

My PR, pull had to be declined for a moment because I spot a bug that the code I wrote effected 2 others routes as well, wich I dont't wanted to do.
I fixed this whith scoping the code to just the component that I wanted affect, both css code and some JS logic.
I made this with help some cloujures and with emotion helpers css function.
After I fixed the issue i opened my PR again and, I got aproved buy the team that I was ready for my first merge.

The feeling was really amazing, even if the code was nothing special, just to have that feeling that you know that your code will go into production and be used by a lot of peoople.
Pretty cool in my opinion.

## What I learend

- Read and understand the code before getting started.
- What is really going on and plan on waht could go wrong.
- Be comftable to just jump into any codebase and start to work.
- Write test , fix braking tests.

## Tips

Don't stress, don't be afraid to do anything wrong,
you will just improve as a developer becasue you will
have a code review where more experince developers will go through
your code and tell you waht was good and what you could improve.
This perhaps sound scarry but this way will just make to a much better developer.
