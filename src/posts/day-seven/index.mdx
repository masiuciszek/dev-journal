# Learning new concepts and new terms

Today I learned a really powerful way of how to make writing tests into one of your best friends to build a successful application.
I was supposed to build a new feature today. My colleague gave me a suggestion to write the test before you build your component.
... Wait what? How can I test something that you haven't built yet?
This is called _test driven development_ and is a really powerful way of writing software.
With help of _TDD_, you will get a better perspective of what functionality the component should have and also make it easier for you as a developer both to write the component but also for testing it.

Yes of course you cant test anything that doesn't exist, but what you do is that you write sudo tests on how you expect it to look.

**for example**

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { render, cleanup, fireEvent } from "@testing-library/react";
import TestEvents from "./TestEvents";

afterEach(cleanup);
describe("<Counter />", () => {
  test("increments counter", () => {
    const { getByTestId } = render(<TestEvents />);

    fireEvent.click(getByTestId("button-up"));

    expect(getByTestId("counter")).toHaveTextContent("1");
  });

  test("decrements counter", () => {
    const { getByTestId } = render(<TestEvents />);

    fireEvent.click(getByTestId("button-down"));

    expect(getByTestId("counter")).toHaveTextContent("-1");
  });
});
```

If you have a simple component like a counter, there is nothing wrong write your tests before like this if you are comfortable to write Unit tests.

If you just want to write a more _Psedu codeish_

```text
  1. render the component
  2. make the button to fire a click event
  3. check to see if the counter value has been changed.
```

## so what I did

Trying the new concept of **TDD** and building a new component for the application, made also a new pull request from my previous test task.
Waiting for a code review right now to be able to move it to the next stage.

## My tips for today

- Try Test-driven development
- Be open to learning new things
