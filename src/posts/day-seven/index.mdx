# Learning new concepts and new terms

Today I learend a really powerful way of how to make writing test into one of your best friend to build a successfull application.
I was supose to build a new feature today. My collegue gave me a sugeston to write the test before you build your component.
... Wait what ? How can I test something that you haven't built yet?
This is called _test driven development_ and is a really powerful way of writing software.
With help of _TDD_ you will get a better perspective what fucntionality the component should have and also make it easier for you as a developer both to write the component but also for testing it.

Yes of course you cant test anything that don't exists, but waht you do is that you write sudo tests on how you expect it to look.

**for example**

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { render, cleanup, fireEvent } from "@testing-library/react";
import TestEvents from "./TestEvents";

afterEach(cleanup);
describe("<Counter />", () => {
  test("increments counter", () => {
    const { getByTestId } = render(<TestEvents />);

    fireEvent.click(getByTestId("button-up"));

    expect(getByTestId("counter")).toHaveTextContent("1");
  });

  test("decrements counter", () => {
    const { getByTestId } = render(<TestEvents />);

    fireEvent.click(getByTestId("button-down"));

    expect(getByTestId("counter")).toHaveTextContent("-1");
  });
});
```

If you have a simple component like a counter, there is nothing wrong write your tests before like this if you are comftable to write Unit tests.

If you just want to write a more _Psedu codeish_

```text
  1. render compoenent
  2. make the button to fire a clik event
  3. check to se if the counter value has been changed.
```

## so what I did

Trying the new concept of **TDD** and building a new component for the application, maked also a new pull request from my previous test task.
Waiting for a code review right now to be able to move it to the next stage.

## My tips for today

- Try Test drive development
- Be open to learn new things
