## Friday

Who does not love Friday's! End of the week, another great week here on the Etravli group. I learned so much new stuff as usual.
Been working on a cool story this week where I managed to configure from the backend a 12-hour clock stamp format so that people in the US for example, would have a much better user experience.
I managed to fix it and it is the best feeling in the world when you complete your task, and when you can solve problems that you just one year ago you would never think about this at all.

There is not so much more that I can say right now. I am just thankful for everything and all the opportunities.
We also had as usual our big Friday meeting and got some positive news, we made a record on trip sales since the COVID outbreak wish is some very positive news.

### tip for today

- Believe in your self
- you are your biggest enemy
- You can accomplish whatever you want
