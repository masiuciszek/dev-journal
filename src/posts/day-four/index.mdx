# Fourth day ⚛🚀🃏

Today it was test day, me and 2 other developers in our team *Vipers*✌🏼, decided to write some unit tests for some applications.
I have written tests before on my own but I really wanted to do this because I wanted to be more comfortable writing unit tests.
We are using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) for testing our components. We where using [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) before but we just migrating from [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) to _react-testing-linrary_.
I really think the logic behind _RTL_ is much clearer for me and makes the components much easier to test.
You just write your test for that given component that you need to test and don't shallow render a whole nested tree structure.

## What I learned

- write tests
- read and understand others code
- rewrite others code

## Tips

- learn to write tests, it is super important to get a better perspective on how your app works.
- Writing tests will make it easier to get into a large codebase that many developers have been working on.
