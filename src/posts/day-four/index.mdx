# Fourth day ⚛🚀🃏

Today it was test day, me and 2 other developers in our team *Vipers*✌🏼, dicided to write some unit tests for some applications.
I have written tests before by my own but I really wanted to do this because I wanted to be more comftable to write unit tests.
We are using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) for testing our components. We where using [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) before but we just migrating from [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) to _react-testing-linrary_.
I really think the logic behind _RTL_ is much clearer for me and make the components much easier to test.
You just write your test for that given component that you need to test, and don't shallow render a whole nested tree structure.

## What I learend

- write tests
- read and understand others code
- rewrite others code

## Tips

- learn to write tests , it is super important to get a better perspetive on how your app works.
- Writing tests will make it easier to get into a large codebase that many devlopers have been working on.
