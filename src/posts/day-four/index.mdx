# Fourth day ⚛🚀🃏

Today it was test day, me and 2 other developers in our team *Vipers*✌🏼, dicided to write some unit tests for some applications.
I have written tests before by my own but I really wanted to do this because I wanted to be more comftable to write unit tests.
We are using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) for testing our components. We where using [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) before but we just migrating from [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) to _react-testing-linrary_.
I really think the logic behind _RTL_ is much clearer for me and make the components much easier to test.
