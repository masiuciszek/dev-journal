## Java code in on the way !! 🛳☕️

Yesterday I made my PR and sitting to fix all my comments I got on my PR.
It took some time but I finally managed to resolve all my comments both on the client-side as go for the serverside story.
It is really cool that you can sit with techs that you never used or learned and really make it happen to ship it into production.
It is a really good feeling.
Other the sitting with my PR I have been in some meetings about feature stories as well as an individual meeting with my team leader.
More about how I feel and what I enjoy at the company and if I need something more or have any questions, we usually have this every third-week.
And Yes it's Friday, who doesn't love Friday? It means a cake day here at the office !!! 🧁🥳

## Tips of the day(repeating stuff) 🙈

- Learn new things (be open to everything)
- You don't have to be an expert on new tech but learn the basics.
