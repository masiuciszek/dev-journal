# Set up the machine!

It was a big day for me today, the first day of my internship at _[EtraveliGroup](https://www.etraveligroup.com/)_.
I was really nervous already 1 week before, just thinking about what could go possibly wrong but I guess that is just how I am.
Everything was just the opposite of what I expected. They were super nice and already after the first day they felt that I was a part of the family.

I knew that this would be my chance to prove to them that this is what I really want and that one day is part of the front-end React team at _[EtraveliGroup](https://www.etraveligroup.com/)_.

## What was my tasks on ?

When I came to the desk in the morning I got a brand new
mac book prop 16inch and with 32 GB ram of memory. I couldn't believe it, it was really amazing, oh I forgot that I got a brand new screen and my task and all the tools I needed with a keyboard and etc.

I had a lot to do today, configure my computer, set up all the SSH key I needed, set up my profile, set up workflows like _Git_ and _Docker_, and a lot of other stuff. The day was really heavy but I really wanted to fix everything today because I wanted to get into the code as soon as possible.
As good news, I managed to set up everything and I was actually happy with what I accomplished today.

They told me that not everyone that is new manages to get everything to work the very first day.

## What was my thoghts

I was tired after the day, but when I reflected on how I felt. I really felt that I am a very lucky guy that got this opportunity.
I will do my best here and hope everything goes well. I learned a lot on the very first day.

## My tips

What I can give you as a tip when you have your first day at your work.
Read the manual slowly and patient, take your time, there is no need for the rush. It will just take more time then you think
. Have fun and try to bind contact to as many colleagues as possible, then you will already make a big step at your new work.
