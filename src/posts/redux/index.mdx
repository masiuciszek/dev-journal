## Old Redux

Oh Redux what I have missed you, I haven't actully worked with Redux for a long time. I think the most modern React application still use Redux in some how bit slowly migrating from redux.
There are so many different options today and speciialy when Context Api just released ther new API with hooks , Redux was not so important to omplement.
Graphql is also one factor , how to handle your state in your React application.
But what I was working on today is that I saw some code that could be changed. I was rewriting some test and I spot on some code that were teting some Redux wrappers.

It is really har d to test and I dinden't know how I should solve this problem at the beginning. I dived deeper into the code base to styudy the logic of the components.
I saw that it was using redux-form and redux-modal as dependency for trigger 2 modals.

I dident see the logix why we where using Redux for this. I think this made it even more complex and it was much harder to test.
