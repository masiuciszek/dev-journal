## Old Redux

Oh Redux what I have missed you, I haven't actually worked with Redux for a long time. I think the most modern React application still use Redux in somehow bit slowly migrating from redux.
There are so many different options today and especially when Context Api just released their new API with hooks, Redux was not so important to complement.
Graphql is also one factor, how to handle your state in your React application.
But what I was working on today is that I saw some code that could be changed. I was rewriting some tests and I spot on some code that was testing some Redux wrappers.

It is really hard to test and I didn't know how I should solve this problem at the beginning. I dived deeper into the codebase to study the logic of the components.
I saw that it was using redux-form and redux-modal as a dependency for trigger 2 modals.

I didn't see the logic why we where using Redux for this. I think this made it even more complex and it was much harder to test.
So we decided that I should remove the redux wrappers around those 2 models. We didn't need Redux in this case and logic would be much straight forward.
I accomplished it, removed unnecessary tests and adding a new test for the modals and it was so easy compared to how it was before with redux. Before making a PR on my work, I also did some e2e test on it to really check that nothing breaks. It worked fine and Made my PR. Tomorrow I will get some comments to see what people think about my code.

## Tips of today

- Read code make you a much better developer
- cleaning the code base will help you to get a better understanding of how it works
