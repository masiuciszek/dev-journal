## About <a name = "about"></a>

This is my Documentation for my biggest school project. My Internship at [EtraveliGroup](https://www.etraveligroup.com/).
I will document every day on  what I do and how it went for every day. Of course there be perhaps some steps that I will not document, that is not subtitle for this blog. Hope You think the story would be intreating and you could take something from this as well.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

* Node >= 10.0

if you have *homeBrew* But not installed node!
``` bash
  brew install node
  brew install npm/yarn
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

``` bash
  git clone <Project url>

  cd into project

  yarn/npm install

Every day we have 2 stand ups one for the whole team in the morning 9am and the second stand-up is around 2pm but then just for the front-end team that you belongs to. It's a great opportunity to tell what you.working on , how it goes and if you possible need some extra help. You really getting a good perspective on what eery person is working on and you can always give some input or vice versa.

I have also been ivolved in some bigger meetings where we have discussed tech improvments in the main application and what we should prioritize. This helped me a lot to grasp what is really going on in the application and what direction the whole team is going at. 

Some other useful meetings have ben the WHY meetings, where we looking into the backlog once a week to find the most important task that we could move into the todo list. Another great oppertinouty to see how the company works and how I can be more involved in the whole work.
