## About <a name = "about"></a>

This is my Documentation for my biggest school project. My Internship at [EtraveliGroup](https://www.etraveligroup.com/).
I will document every day on , what I do and how it went for every day. Of course there be perhaps some steps that I will not document, that is between me and *Etraveli*. Hope You think the story would be intreating and you could take something from this as well.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
