## About <a name = "about"></a>

This is my Documentation for my biggest school project. My Internship at [EtraveliGroup](https://www.etraveligroup.com/).
I will document every day (almost every day) on  what I do and how it went for the day. Of course there be perhaps some steps that I will not document, that is not subtitle for this blog. Hope You think the story would be intreating and you could take something from this as well. I am really exited to start this journy and I know I will learn a lot and become a much better devloper thanks of this.
Woring from home/school is not the same to really work in a company.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
You dont' need to do this but if you want to see how I did something id could be a nie way of see how it works. For example my custom hooks of handleling localStorage and custom theme with help of Styled-components üíÖüèº

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

* Node >= 10.0

if you have *homeBrew* But not installed node!
``` bash
  brew install node
  brew install npm/yarn
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

``` bash
  git fork the <Project repo>
  
  git clone <Project url>

  cd into project

  yarn/npm install
```

Have fun !üòÉ

## Meetingns I have been involved in <a name = "meetings" > </a>

Every day we have 2 stand ups one for the whole team in the morning 9am and the second stand-up is around 2pm but then just for the front-end team that you belongs to. It's a great opportunity to tell what you.working on , how it goes and if you possible need some extra help. You really getting a good perspective on what eery person is working on and you can always give some input or vice versa.

I have also been ivolved in some bigger meetings where we have discussed tech improvments in the main application and what we should prioritize. This helped me a lot to grasp what is really going on in the application and what direction the whole team is going at. 

Some other useful meetings have ben the WHY meetings, where we looking into the backlog once a week to find the most important task that we could move into the todo list. Another great oppertinouty to see how the company works and how I can be more involved in the whole work. 

#### Retro meeting
Every fifth week we have a retro meeting in the team where we discuss on how it went , both posetive things and what can be improved, also som questions that we would like to be answered.


## What I learned <a name = "learned" > </a>

Where should I start, I learned a lot. It is a really big difference on working on your own projects, school projects comparing to working in a really big team in a serious company. You learn how to litsen to other devlopers and how you shoudl cooperate in the best possible way. 
Learned new React koncepts and how to think when you write code. Write code in a test covrage way, where you actually write the tests first before you write any test. This just because you will hava a much better perspective on how you component logic should look like and work.
